for code reviewer 

how it works?

Note: You should download the code.py file in order to run the program

System: You are a code review assistant. Provide detailed suggestions to improve the given Python code.
User: def get_quotient(a, b):
    return a // b
Assistant: Sure! Here's an example of how you could rewrite your function using a try-except block to handle division by zero errors:

```python
def get_quotient(a, b):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers"""
    try:
        # Attempt to divide a by b
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Handle division by zero error
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
```

In this updated version of the function, we use a try-except block to handle any potential division by zero errors. If an exception is raised when attempting to perform the division operation (i.e., if `b` is equal to 0), the error message "Error: Cannot divide by zero" will be printed instead of crashing the program.
